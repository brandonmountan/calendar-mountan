## Description

The motivation behind building this project was to use what we leanred in week 5 (Third Party API's) and apply it to a real project. The main third party api that was used was jQuery. jQuery has a different syntax so there was a little bit of a struggle to get everything to function correctly. I built this project so I could produce a website that provides 24 1 hour time blocks for the current day that users could save things to the specific hour. I learned a lot about jQuery as well as how to use day.js.
